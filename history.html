        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Out of the compassion to help the new Chinese immigrant in Northeast Philadelphia, Mingchu Pearl Huynh founded NEPCA in March 2018 with the encouragement and assistance of Jared Solomon State Representative Office. Prior to that, Pearl had worked for three years as a Chinese interpreter at Public Health Center #10 in Northeast Philadelphia, where she encountered every day many non-English Speaking Chinese immigrants, who were newcomers to Philadelphia, facing many issues due to lacking language help in navigating the for public services. In addition, most Asians are not involved in civic activities and thus they are misunderstood, their voice and suffering are not heard, and their welfare is overlooked. NEPCA aims to bridge this gap in services to make life easier for this group of people; at the same time, engage them with our City to be included in the system. </p>
        <p>In the beginning, Pearl has built up NEPCA communication networks on WeChat social media to connect with thousands of local Chinese residents and let the residents connect to each other for information exchange and virtually get help. To set up program services from scratch is impossible with no funding and expertise, so Andrew Dalzell who was Jared’s Chief of Staff at the time suggested finding existing services out there and connecting them with the Chinese community. With this direction, Pearl has proactively reached out to many services organizations, helped them set up service, provide Chinese language assistance, and shared NEPCA’s client base. The collaborations resulted in growing information and services to the local Chinese, from education, health and wellness, cultural and entertainment, housing, finance, real estate, social and welfare benefits, immigration services, crime victim services, childcare, energy assistance, town watch & safety,  etc. Slow but steadily growing, NEPCA’s partners started employing Chinese staff to answer the needs. NEPCA has effectively escalated the social attention to the needs of the Chinese community, which has resulted in many language services available to Chinese residents. The method has been so successful that NEPCA was praised by State Rep. Jared Solomon in 2019 and he has encouraged other ethnic communities to use the NEPCA services implementation model. </p>
        <p>Pearl has been a full-time volunteer and basically operated NEPCA from her home. In NEPCA’s four years anniversary, there are about two hundred registered volunteers and many resources are in-kind donations from the local community. As it marked four years milestone,  on 3/14/2022, NEPCA has touched the lives of thousands of Chinese and assisted many enjoying equitable social benefits, becoming more informed and engaged in their community. Founder Mingchu Pearl Huynh and the Northeast Philadelphia Chinese Association’s (NEPCA) story has been covered in major media such as the New York Times, Philadelphia Magazine, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and Philly10 Live TV program. </p>
